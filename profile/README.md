# MAHF

A framework for modular construction and evaluation of metaheuristics.

MAHF enables easy construction and experimental analysis of metaheuristics by breaking them down into their fundamental components.

The framework supports not only evolutionary algorithms, but also any other metaheuristic framework, including non-population-based, constructive, and specifically hybrid approaches.
